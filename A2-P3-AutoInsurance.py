    #Firstly i need to take in 3 inputs, gender, age and price
    #use age and gender (with the help of if statements) to calculate the percentage that will be used to aquire their insurance 
    #use my percentage i aquired with my calculation and the price of the car to calculate monthly insurance
    #Print result
